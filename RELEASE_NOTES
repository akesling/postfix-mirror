This is the Postfix 3.5 (experimental) release.

The stable Postfix release is called postfix-3.4.x where 3=major
release number, 4=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-3.5-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 3.3 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-3.4
before proceeding.

Major changes with snapshot 20190517
====================================

Search order support for check_ccert_access. Search order support
for other tables is in design (canonical_maps, virtual_alias_maps,
transport_maps, etc.).

The following check_ccert_access setting uses the built-in search
order: it first looks up the client certificate fingerprint, then
the client certificate public-key fingerprint, and it stops when a
decision is made.

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    smtpd_mumble_restrictions =
        ...
        check_ccert_access hash:/etc/postfix/ccert-access
        ...

The following setting, with explicit search order, produces the
exact same result:

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    smtpd_mumble_restrictions =
        ...
        check_ccert_access {
            hash:/etc/postfix/ccert-access {
                search_order = cert_fingerprint, pubkey_fingerprint } }
        ...

The check_ccert_access search order also supports the subject and
issuer properties. Support is planned for rfc822name and smtputf8mailbox.

Incompatibility with snapshot 20190427
======================================

Postfix now normalizes IP addresses received with XCLIENT, XFORWARD,
or with the HaProxy protocol, for consistency with direct connections
to Postfix. This may change the appearance of logging, and the way
that check_client_access will match subnets of an IPv6 address.
